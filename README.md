# PathFinderRL

This repository represents the practical work of my Bachelor Thesis. 

## Introduction

I use the OpenAI gym with multiple modifications to train an RL agent to navigate to a goal point without crashing. The modifications are:
- Using a depth camera instead of the LiDAR for observations
- Goal point navigation instead of simply trying to survive as long as possible
- new custom maze world
- general modifications to the NN architecture, reward structure, etc.
